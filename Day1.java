/*Key Coding Question (Day 1)

Can you declare and initialize basic variables in Java and print them in a formatted message?"

So variable is basically telling java to label some space in the memory so that we can store some stuff in it 
declating means what type of data we storing data can be int,string,bool.long,double
we say that to java because java is statically typed and it need to be told before hand what we plan to doing to spcae in momory
initilizaing is storing some value into that space
